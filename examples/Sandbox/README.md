# Sandbox Flow Configuration

> "A Jupyter sandbox environment coupled into the high-order Navier-Stokes solver Xcompact3d", to appear soon at [@JupyterCon](https://twitter.com/JupyterCon), by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch), [@momba98](https://github.com/momba98), [@filipi](https://github.com/filipi) & [@jhsilvestrini](https://twitter.com/jhsilvestrini).

This work aims to break many of the barriers to entry in a Navier-Stokes solver by coupling it to a Jupyter sandbox environment. For students in computational fluid dynamics, it provides a direct hands-on experience and a safe place for practising and learning, while for advanced users and code developers, it works as a rapid prototyping tool.

Try it with the new [Xcompact3d-toolbox](https://github.com/fschuch/xcompact3d_toolbox).
