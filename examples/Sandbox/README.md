This work aims to break many of the barriers to entry in a Navier-Stokes solver by coupling it to a Jupyter sandbox environment. For students in computational fluid dynamics, it provides a direct hands-on experience and a safe place for practising and learning, while for advanced users and code developers, it works as a rapid prototyping tool.

Try it with the new [Xcompact3d-toolbox](https://github.com/fschuch/xcompact3d_toolbox).
